PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY:

This script is highly experimental, and may not always work correctly. If you do encounter any issues when running this script,
feel free to open an issue on the github.

The purpose of this script is to generate a single map cache, otherwise known as a main menu cache. This cache has all kinds of uses.
with the main one being campaign porting, however this will also work with multiplayer maps.

Some issues that you may encounter when using this cache include:

- General instability

- Broken 0.6 Forge

- Broken Campaign Porting (maps do load, but have multiple issues including, invisble bipeds, and general scripting issues)


HOW TO SETUP THE SCRIPT:

Take the "mainmenucache" folder, and put it in the "tagmods" folder, which is in turn located within the "mods" folder
the final directory should look like "mods\tagmods\mainmenucache"

Inside the "mainmenucache" folder, there should be a folder called "H3Maps'. This is where you'll need to put your Halo 3 Map files.
PLEASE, and I'm only going to repeat this once, PLEASE ensure that you have all the correct files in the "H3Maps" folder, as without them, the script will fail.

DISCLAIMER: Due to copyright and legal reasons, I cannot provide the files you need, but there are plenty of tutorials out there that'll show you how to extract the files form the Halo 3 360 disc.

The files that you should have in the "H3Maps" folder include:

- mainmenu.map

- shared.map

- campaign.map

- "info" folder, which contain all the map info files, which are in turn used to update the exising scenario indices within ElDewrito's own map files

If all of these steps have been followed, then you should just be able open FMM, and install the mod as you would with any other.


To actually use the cache, just wipe all the exisitng files within the "maps" folder and replace them with the newly generated files.
